The ideas is to consider every possible contingent claim based on [sate prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_prices)."

Denoted $S = \\{S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_n\\}$ This is a discrete approximation for what is actually a continuous distribution. However for practical purposes and we choose feasible discrete intervals. (ex. 80, 90, 100, 110).\n",

It reflects the time-value of money, the market consensus about future risk, and no arbitrage (ex. suppose there're only 3 possible terminal states the underlying could end up at: $ S_{i} \\in \\{80, 90, 100\\} $, then the state prices $\\vec{\\pi} = [\\pi_{80}, \\pi_{90}, \\pi_{100}]$ tells us today's price of recieving 1 dollar in the future is the underlyig ends at that subscript).\n",
